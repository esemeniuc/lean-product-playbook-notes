# define your target customer

## fishing for customers
- matching a product with a customer is lke fishing
-- product=bait, customer=fish
-- can catch unexpected fish
-- only can test hypothesis by throwing bait out into the market

- eg. quicken for individuals was repurposed as customers reused it
-- move up and down market
-- eg. use course mgmt software for professional training as upmarket move

## how to segment your market
- firmographics: demographics for firms
-- see SIC and NAICS

### segmentation types
- demographic (age gender income)
- psychographic (attitudes opinions values interests), makes demographics incidental, eg moms -> women
- behavioral (how often an action is taken, eg trading stocks)
- needs (feature can cost extra due to need, eg cloud backup monthly fee)

## users vs buyers
- end user != buyer
-- salesforce bought by VP of sales, purchase decision by CTO, used by salespeople

## tech life cycle
1. innovaters (enthusiasts love being on the cutting edge)
2. early adopters (motivation is gaining an edge, not love)
3. early majority (pragmatists, they wait for the path to be forged)
4. late majority (doubt utility of new tech, adopt only when pressured, eg financial cost, competiton, old stuff being unsupported)
5. laggards (skeptic of innovation, hate change)

The chasm exists between early adopters and early majority

## personas
"a precise definition of our user and what they wish to accomplish"
- used as a target customer
-- the fact that it will be written down, discussed, and shared helps everyone be on same page
- helps product team choose important features for good ux, providing foundation and reasoning
- each team member makes small individual choices, persona allows more congruent and additive work rather than discorddant and counterproductive

### persona details
- name
- photo
- important quote about person
- job title
- demographics
- needs/goals
- relevant motivations and attitudes
- pain points in current solution
- level of relevant knowledge
- product usage environment (office/couch/coffee shop)
- tech lifestyle classification
- other relevant attributes

their photo and quote bring them to life

## how to create personas
- do not use average data, us fighter pilot example
- use surveys or customer discover intervivews
- revise persona after talking with customer

## potential problems with personas
- persona is a first draft that gets iterated on
- refer to persona during discussions, proposals, and decisions
- never replace customer with persona, keep conversation going
- create new personas if your product is attracting different types of customers
- talking with passionate custoers (eg those who post on fb, ig) will help sharpen hypothesis about target market, and what problems your solution helps solve
