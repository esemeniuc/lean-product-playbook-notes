why products fail:
product doesnt meet customer need better than alts
need product market fit
people struggle with application of lean startup concepts
eg gym: signup, go, but unsure what to do

product-market fit pyramid:
1. the target customer
2. the customer's underserved needs

***THE PRODUCT-MARKET FIT***

3. value proposition
4. product feature set
5. product UX

The lean product process (6 steps):
1. determine the target customers
2. identify underserved customer needs
3. define the value proposition
4. select the MVP feature set
5. create MVP
6. test MVP with customers
