Problem space vs solution space

products you build exist in solution space, incl prototypes, or products used by customer. 

customer needs are the problem space, eg customer pain point, desire, job, user storey.

## the space pen
thinking of recording notes in space, one could think of a pen. lots of money was spent on making a pen usable in space. the myth is that the russians used pencils, saving lots of r&d cost, and "thinking out side the box". One can ask for a writing instrument in the solution space, which allows for pencils, but is still constraining. 

A note taking tool would allow for things like voice notes, but that would be less freeform, and not allow for easy scanning, or be electricity-free.

## problems define markets
what is the competitor to turbo tax: pen and paper, tax accountants, other software.
the solution space is tax prepration.

- write product requirements without falling into the solution space
-- focus on the what before going into the how.
--- what: the product benefits given to the consumer, problem space
--- how: how the product delivers the "what" to the consumer, solution space

## outside-in product development
inside==company, outside==customers+market

inside out: allows a team to misunderstand the problem space. eg. employees come up with idea of what's good to build, it is not checked with customers to see if it solves the problem.

talk to customers to avoid not understandig the problem, GET OUT OF THE BUILDING (GOOB).

outside: understanding the customer's problem space, what they like and don't like about current solutions. forms a robhust problem space understanding before designing the product. involes sharing hypotheses and getting customer feedback to test these ideas (user centered design).

## should you listen to customers
henry ford: if i asked people what they wanted, they would say a faster horse

henry ford and steve jobs used inside-out methods to build the next breakthrough.
don't expect customers to come up with a breakthrough, but the above sentence isn't an excuse to avoid talking to customers, since the understanding gained helps one come up with new ideas.

steve jobs: you must start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology

## using the solution space to discover the problem space
product team must extract abstract benefits and relative importance.
observe customer pain points. customers are very good about giving feedback in solution space. feedback from solution space allows testing of problem space hypothesis

"customers dont care about your solution. they care about their problems"
